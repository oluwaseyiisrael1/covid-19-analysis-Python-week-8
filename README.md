# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Description
This project analyzes the global COVID-19 dataset to understand the spread, trends, vaccination progress, and impacts of the pandemic across different countries.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Import and clean COVID-19 global data.
- Analyze time trends: cases, deaths, vaccinations.
- Compare metrics across countries.
- Visualize trends using charts and maps.
- Communicate findings in a structured notebook.

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Plotly (for interactive maps)
- Git & GitHub

## ▶️ How to Run This Project
1. Clone the repository or download the `.ipynb` file.
2. Open it using [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) or VSCode with the Jupyter extension.
3. Run the notebook cells in order (Shift + Enter).
4. All charts and outputs will be generated automatically.

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Country X had the highest vaccine rollout rate.
- Cases surged in Country Y during late 2020.
- Vaccination positively correlates with drop in new cases.
